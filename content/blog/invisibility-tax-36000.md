## The Shocking Statistics


Let's start with the numbers that should keep every restaurant owner awake at night:

- (BOLD) 58% of customers (END BOLD) now use voice search and AI assistants to find restaurants
- (BOLD) 90% of restaurant websites (END BOLD) are invisible to these AI platforms
- (BOLD) $80 billion (END BOLD) in purchases will be made via voice commerce by 2026

More than half of your potential customers are asking AI assistants where to eat. But if your website isn't AI-ready, those customers never even know you exist.

The AI assistant simply recommends your competitor instead.

## The Math: How Invisibility Costs You $36,000 Per Year


A typical 150-seat restaurant:
- Average table turn: 2x per night
- Average party size: 3 people
- Average ticket: $45/person
- Operating nights: 300/year

Annual capacity: ~90,000 potential customers


If your restaurant is invisible to AI (like 90% of restaurants), you're competing for only 40% of the market.

> The brutal math:
> • 15% lost discovery = ~13,500 lost potential customers/year
> • At $45 average ticket = ~$607,500 in lost revenue
> • At 6% restaurant margin = $36,450 in lost annual profit

## Why You're Invisible (Even With a Beautiful Website)


Your website might look gorgeous to human visitors. But AI assistants aren't human.

They don't "see" your website. They parse code, read structured data, and query databases.

### The Three Killers of AI Visibility



That beautiful PDF menu you paid a designer to create? AI can't read it. To an AI assistant, it's just an image file.

When someone asks Alexa "Does [Your Restaurant] have gluten-free pasta?" AI has no answer. It recommends a competitor with HTML text instead.


Structured data (schema markup) is invisible code that tells AI exactly what your content means. Without it, AI can't distinguish between your restaurant's name, a menu item, or your hours.


Photos of your dishes look great to humans. To AI, they're unlabeled image files. That photo of your signature lasagna? AI sees "image_047.jpg"—not "homemade lasagna with bolognese sauce, $24."
