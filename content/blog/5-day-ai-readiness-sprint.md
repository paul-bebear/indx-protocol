## Why 5 Days?


Traditional SEO takes 6-12 months to show results. Agencies tell you to "be patient" while charging $2,000/month.

> AI readiness is different.


It's not about building authority over time. It's about implementing technical infrastructure that either exists or doesn't.

Once the schema markup is in place, AI assistants can read your site immediately. There's no ramping up. No waiting for Google to index.

## Is 5 Days Really Enough?


Yes. Here's why:

Traditional SEO = Building authority (takes months)
AI readiness = Technical infrastructure (exists or doesn't)

Once schema is implemented, AI can read it immediately.

> The 5-day timeline:
> • 1 day for audit and planning
> • 3 days for implementation
> • 1 day for testing and deployment
