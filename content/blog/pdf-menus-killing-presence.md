## The PDF Menu Problem


> 78% of restaurants use PDF menus on their websites.


They're elegant, they're branded, they showcase your food beautifully.

But AI assistants can't read PDFs.

To ChatGPT, Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, your PDF menu is just an image file. It might as well be blank.

When a customer asks their AI assistant "Does [Your Restaurant] have gluten-free pasta?" or "What's the price of your cheeseburger?" the AI has no answer. It recommends a competitor with an HTML menu instead.

## Real-World Impact


### Scenario 1: The Gluten-Free Query


A customer with celiac disease asks Alexa:

> "Alexa, find me an Italian restaurant with gluten-free pasta near me."


- Alexa: "I found [Restaurant A] nearby."
- Customer: "Do they have gluten-free pasta?"
- Alexa: "I don't have that information."

- Alexa: "[Restaurant B] has gluten-free pasta options including penne and fusilli. They have 4.5 stars. Would you like directions?"

Which restaurant gets the customer?

## The Technical Explanation


### How AI Reads Websites



1. They scan HTML for schema markup
2. They extract text from HTML elements
3. They identify entities (dishes, prices, ingredients)
4. They store this in knowledge graphs

### How AI Handles PDFs


When AI encounters a PDF:

1. It downloads the file
2. It attempts OCR (optical character recognition)
3. It tries to extract unstructured text
4. It fails to identify structure or relationships

> The extracted text might look like:
> "Our Menu APPETIZERS Bruschetta 12 Mains Lasagna 24"
> 
> AI can't tell that "Bruschetta" is a dish and "12" is its price. It can't identify ingredients or dietary tags.

## The Cost of PDF Menus


### Lost Queries


Every day, potential customers ask AI assistants:
- "Does [Restaurant] have vegan options?"
- "How much is the lobster at [Restaurant]?"
- "What time does [Restaurant] stop serving lunch?"

With a PDF menu: AI has no answer.
With an HTML menu: AI can answer confidently.

### The Math



For a restaurant getting 50 AI queries per day:
- PDF menu: 10-15 mentions
- HTML menu with schema: 45-50 mentions

That's 35 customers per day choosing your competitor instead of you.

## What Proper Menu Schema Looks Like


Here's what AI sees with proper markup:

MenuItem schema includes:
- Name: Bruschetta al Pomodoro
- Description: Grilled Tuscan bread topped with vine-ripened tomatoes
- Price: $12
- Dietary tags: Vegetarian, Vegan

AI can now answer:
- "What vegan options does [Restaurant] have?"
