## The Discovery Shift


Five years ago, customers opened Google, typed "Italian restaurant near me," and scrolled through results.

Today? They ask Alexa. They ask Siri. They ask ChatGPT.

> The data shows this shift is already massive:
> 
> • 58% of customers now use voice search and AI assistants to find local businesses
> • $80 billion in purchases will happen through voice commerce by 2026
> • 90% of restaurant websites are invisible to these AI platforms


The majority of your potential customers are asking AI for recommendations. But if you're like 90% of restaurants, AI doesn't know you exist.

## How AI Makes Recommendations


### Old Way (2019):


1. Customer searches Google
2. Google shows 10 results
3. Customer visits 3-4 websites
4. Customer makes decision

### New Way (2026):


1. Customer asks AI assistant
2. AI queries structured data sources
3. AI returns 1-2 recommendations
4. Customer makes decision

Your goal used to be: Be in the top 10
Your goal now is: Be one of the 1-2

## Why 90% of Restaurants Are Invisible


AI doesn't browse websites like humans.

### What AI Sees vs. What Humans See


- Beautiful photos of your dishes
- Elegant PDF menu
- Stylish design
- Smooth animations

- "IMG_0472.jpg" (unlabeled image)
- "menu_spring_2025.pdf" (unreadable file)
- "No structured data found"

> The beautiful website you paid $5,000 for is essentially blank to AI.

## The Confidence Score


AI assistants use confidence scoring to determine recommendations. Here's what matters:

### High Confidence (+points):

✓ Schema markup present
✓ Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone)
✓ Machine-readable menu
✓ FAQ content
✓ Recent activity

### Low Confidence (-points):

✗ PDF menu
✗ Image-only content
✗ Inconsistent information
✗ No schema markup

Most AI assistants use a threshold of 0.7 for recommendations.

- Score 0.7+: Included in recommendations
- Score <0.4: Invisible—never mentioned

Your competitor at 0.92 gets recommended. You at 0.3 don't exist.

## The First-Mover Window


We're in a unique moment:

> AI adoption is high (58%) but optimization is low (10%).


Restaurants that optimize in 2026 will:
- Dominate AI recommendations
- Build authority that compounds
- Establish presence before saturation

Restaurants that wait until 2027 will:
- Compete with optimized competitors
- Pay more for the same results
- Lose the first-mover advantage
