Schema Markup for Restaurants: A Complete Guide (2026)

(SUBTITLE)
Schema markup is the difference between being invisible to AI and being recommended by ChatGPT, Siri, and Alexa.

This guide includes copy-paste code templates. No developer required.

What Is Schema Markup?

Schema markup is invisible code that tells AI assistants exactly what your content means.

(H3)
Without Schema

AI sees: "Text about a place called Trattoria Roma with an address, phone, and hours."

(H3)
With Schema

AI sees: "This is a Restaurant named Trattoria Roma located at 123 Main Street, New York, phone +1-212-555-0123, open daily 11am-10pm."

(QUOTE)
The difference: Without schema, AI guesses. With schema, AI knows.

Schema Is Non-Negotiable

Without schema:
✗ AI can't read your menu
✗ AI can't answer questions
✗ You're invisible to voice search

With schema:
✓ AI knows what you serve
✓ AI answers customer questions
✓ You appear in voice search

The choice is simple.
